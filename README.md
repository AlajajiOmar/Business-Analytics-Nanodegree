> This repository contains my projects for [Udacity's Business Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) Nanodegree Program. Throughout the course, I gained knowledge and proficiency 
  in fundamental data skills that are transferable across various disciplines and business sectors. Specifically, I acquired the ability to analyze data and construct models using Excel, retrieve information from 
  databases using SQL, and generate meaningful data visualizations utilizing Tableau.
 
 
 # Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization
 
 > During this project, I delved into an interactive data dashboard that focused on Malaria in Africa, with the aim of revealing valuable insights. Additionally, I composed a brief report that expounded on each insight, 
   while also detailing the methodology used to extract information and arrive at my conclusions based on the dashboard.
   
   
# Project 2: Analyze NYSE Data

> For this project, I employed statistical analysis and spreadsheet tools, including Excel, to examine data from more than 500 companies listed on the New York 
  Stock Exchange. Additionally, I projected financial metrics based on three hypothetical scenarios for a chosen company from the NYSE dataset.
  
  
# Project 3: Query a Digital Music Store Database

> During this project, I conducted queries on a digital music store database that contained crucial data on the store's media, staff, and clientele. The insights 
  gained from analyzing this database allowed me to assist the store in comprehending the music genres that were frequently purchased, the regional distribution of their customers, and devising strategies for optimizing   
  their business practices.
  
  
# Project 4: Build Data Dashboards

> In this project,I built interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. I also used a dataset of YouTube Data in    the US to visualize views per state and the degree of 
  satisfaction, find the correlation between them, and more.
